# imagenscript-v0.01

Welcome!!!!! 
I am so excited.
Really!

This repl will spin up a stable diffusion 2.0 query script 

I hope my joy while putting this together bleeds into the content and people who end up using and even improving upon this tool.

First things first , I set this script up as a set and forget ML model image generator. 

I realized since an ML model realy isn't all that accurate (current public ones) , although very good at creating art it isn't exactly 1 to 1 words to images. 
Meaning since that we don't really need to be so precise , we can set multiple themed lists and have a function choose from those themed lists at random! 

This script has some error handling but over all very cursory. 

This script has a recursive function call so that if the script fails that human intervention is not necessary. 

So just add in the lists of words you would like to generate and hit the run button!! 

Thank you for checking out my work
